Thank you for coming to my grad party and for the nice gifts that omg smell heavenly. I will certainly indulge them as I try to relax this summer, but more than that, the best gift you have blessed me with is your friendship. Thanks for staying by side and keeping in touch with me all this time, for being a great listener and mentor when I need one, and for always being a supportive friend. Cheers to graduating, my fellow potato C: oh and may the odds be ever in our favor for more random starbucks encounters :P

MICHELLE LIU HAPPY BIRTHDAY
i&#039;m still not fully sure of when we met, but i&#039;m assuming around pidgeon&#039;s class freshman year. since then, you&#039;ve been a large part of some of my favorite memories of high school. from crashing your HOSA room both years (don&#039;t tell ms. rogers) to our band room shenanigans (don&#039;t tell ms. d), i&#039;ve always appreciated your puns (lie), your incessant need to sleep, and the fact that you always understand my jokes even if no one else catches it (similar maturity levels, i think we said). you&#039;re an amazing person with a perspective that I&#039;ve always appreciated and you&#039;re incredibly easy to talk to, and as much as i hate you and as much as i hate to say it, i&#039;m really going to miss you next year.  congrats on finally becoming an adult; maybe now you&#039;ll act like it. but probably not &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 2:39am EDT</div><div>Trevor Chun<br /></div><div class="comment">Happy Birthday!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, May 10, 2017 at 1:54am EDT</div><div>Charlie Li<br /></div><div class="comment">Happy Birthday Michelle!

As many of you know, several friends and I created a  service project called Bring Smiles to Orphans to raise money for the orphanage that Maggie was adopted from. We&#039;ve raised $2500+ of our $4000 goal already! The next part of our project is a T-shirt fundraiser. These shirts are $10 and come in a variety of sizes, styles (regular, ladies v-neck, and kids) and colors (black, sapphire, aqua). If you would like to purchase one or just make a donation, please let me know! All proceeds go towards buying the winter supplies for the orphanage kids.

Most of you know that my youngest sister, Maggie, is adopted from China. Recently, we contacted her orphanage for her adoption anniversary and realized that they are in need of winter supplies. As a result, a few friends and I created a project called Bring Smiles to Orphans to fundraise money for this orphanage. We are trying to raise $4000 to buy these goods. We hope to travel to China this winter break and deliver the supplies in person, as well as volunteer there. This project will go through a nonprofit called Hearts2Hearts Children&#039;s Foundation, so please like that page for updates about our project! The link to our gofundme page is also attached. Every little bit counts and all donations will go towards buying the kids the things they need. Living in Johns Creek, we often take what we have for granted, but sometimes, the money we spend on a couple of Starbucks coffees or a T-shirt could really make a big difference in these kids&#039; lives. Please support us by donating, sharing our gofundme link, and spreading the word!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 16, 2016 at 1:59pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Caitlin Pintavorn are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, September 9, 2016 at 7:17pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Siddarth Seemakurti are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, September 1, 2016 at 2:06pm EDT</div><div>Jonathan Hsieh<br /></div>Jonathan Hsieh added a new photo to Michelle Liu&#039;s timeline — with Michelle Liu.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, August 28, 2016 at 9:50pm EDT</div><div>Thomas Moy<br /></div><div class="comment">1.

Thank you for always being such an amazing, fantastic best friend. I&#039;m so lucky to have met such a wonderful best friend. I still clearly remember when I first met you in 3rd grade and both of us were so shy, and now, we laugh and cry with each other, freaking out together over chem and lang and an assortment of other things. Thank you for always having my back and being there for me. You are such a beautiful, kind, smart, hilarious, puny, and super mega foxy awesome hot (tbt to the good ol&#039; days) bffl &lt;3 Hope you have the most amazing birthday ever!! *&lt;:D

i feel like i say this every year on your birthday, but its true.
since 3rd grade:
you really are one of my bffls and i couldn&#039;t imagine life without you
you seriously light up my day when im down and you&#039;re always there for me when i need... well anything, really (lol i swear im not needy)
as i went thru our memories for this super random collage, DISCLAIMER: tbh i may have cried a tiny bit haha im cheesy sorry i can&#039;t help it also i like cheese. a lot. 

last summer was one of my favorites definitely and ill never forget it..
after college we can go to vegas to pursue our side-jobs as professional poker players lol
also we need to plan that senior year spring break vacayy yassssss

anyways, yeah my thoughts are really random but thats just me hehe
well hope you enjoyed this!

you&#039;re the best a friend could ask for... happy birthday girly &lt;3
p.s. don&#039;t worry i spared you this time, but im saving the ugliest pictures of us for when you&#039;re 70... and there&#039;s a lot, o goodness ;)</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 10, 2016 at 12:37am EDT</div><div>Maria Xiong<br /></div><div class="comment">happy birthday Michelle! you&#039;re still a freshie in my heart &lt;333</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 10, 2016 at 12:28am EDT</div><div>Thomas Moy<br /></div><div class="comment">hey michelle

When I went back through the &quot;See Friendship&quot; tab between us to look for potential inspiration for this post, I noticed how pitiful our public friendship is lmao :P

You actually haven&#039;t changed at all since 7th grade, so whether you&#039;re turning 13 or 17, you know there&#039;s always one person who&#039;s thinking about you on your special day &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, May 10, 2016 at 12:00am EDT</div><div>Natalie Hung<br /></div><div class="comment">HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISHYA!!!

- please give us your $5 or bring food for ~25 people (if you are bringing food, message one of us so we don&#039;t end up with 200 bags of chips)
- if you aren&#039;t bringing food, we need the $5 ASAP so we can buy food (we&#039;ll be getting pizza!!) and drinks, decorations, etc.
- IF YOU CAN&#039;T MAKE THE PARTY, please bring your gift to one of us so we can give it to that person at the party.

I got really confused cause I couldn&#039;t find you on fb to post this but then I realized I typed in &quot;Mishya&quot; instead of your actual name. lol. whoops. ANYWAYS, I have written you a birthday letter although I don&#039;t know when I&#039;ll be able to give it to you...it&#039;ll be like your Christmas present LOL. Maybe I&#039;ll just mail it to you...that would probably be quicker tbh. Okay nvm. point is I&#039;m so so so thankful God has blessed me with you in my life. You are one of my closest friends and I find it really easy to talk to you about everything that&#039;s going on in my life. Sitting next to each other that first night of Nashville, I thought to myself &quot;oh that&#039;s that super talented flute player i feel awkotaco&quot;. But our first conversation with each other proved to be one of the funniest, yet tender moments of my life because I realized throughout that week, you had quickly become like a sister to me (or more specifically, a Nashville-definition of a super salty sister hehe). It&#039;s always so uplifting to be around you. And even though, we never sat next to each other during MYSO, at least we got to sit next to each other at all-state? hahaha. AND OUR RATCH PIZZA EATING/WALKING IN DOWNTOWN ATHENS. Alrighty,well since I&#039;m starting to write what I wrote on your letter, I&#039;m gonna stop. I hope you have an amazing day &lt;3 Tell Maggie and Jeremy I said hi :) oh yeah, and goodluck on the AP world exam heh. #SSSTWS #itsalwaysajamsesswithyou #breakingsticksandwalkingtoCali #telekinetic #fofyoufunctions #ithinkilosttotoro</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 10, 2015 at 11:56am EDT</div><div>Judy Li<br /></div><div class="comment">Happy birthday Michelle!!!! &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 10, 2015 at 11:42am EDT</div><div>Heather Lee<br /></div><div class="comment">Happy Birthday!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 10, 2015 at 11:30am EDT</div><div>Avni Kakkar<br /></div><div class="comment">Happy Birthday Michelle!!!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, May 10, 2015 at 11:27am EDT</div><div>Jasmin Gao<br /></div><div class="comment">MICHELLE!!! *&lt;:D HAPPY SWEET SIXTEEN!! 
You are such an amazing, hilarious, delightful, beautiful best friend that anybody could ever ask for, and I&#039;m so glad that I can call you one of my best friends. Thanks for always dealing with me and my moments of random weirdness in chem :P Keep being the awesome, fun, wonderful, and supermegafoxyawesomehot person you are!

Michellee
Well my earliest memory of you was in 6th grade in Mrs Robersons class because we sat right next to each other, and we talked nonstop haha

TBH
Anyways michelle
Thanks for coldly rejecting me in 7th grade... Do you how bad i felt? 
Jkjk its all ok i forgive you. Well more like you should forgive me...

Im pretty sure our youngest siblings have talked to each other more than we have these past 2 years, but im still thankful that youre my friend haha. 

We have shared alot of fun memories, like when i hugged you when we played manhunt during the summer haha (you were so short like awk) and when we had awkward kik conversations with each other every morning :3

Anyhow, i guess life has to move on, but your still one of my best friends, and your hair still does look wet when you tie it back.

Thanks for being such an amazing friend and thank you dearly in advance for what you will do for me in the future!</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, August 10, 2014 at 4:23pm EDT</div><div>Sarah Yang<br /></div><div class="comment">oh i saw you at northpoint yesterday btw</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, July 30, 2014 at 12:44am EDT</div>Northview UNICEF has approved your request to join this group.<div><br /><div class="comment">139 members</div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, July 28, 2014 at 9:35am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Cathy Ni are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, July 20, 2014 at 1:01pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Callahan Proctor are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 18, 2014 at 10:16am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Cam Lee Neuwirth are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, July 13, 2014 at 12:26am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Kalyani Ballur are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 11, 2014 at 6:06pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Stanley Hu are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, July 7, 2014 at 5:00pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Whitney Elise Engeron are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, July 6, 2014 at 6:50pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Ernesto Barquet Jr are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, July 6, 2014 at 3:16pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Krishna Desai are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 4, 2014 at 9:36pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu completed a mission on Zombie Tsunami.<div>Destroy 15 things with the Tsunami!<br /><div class="comment">Complete missions to fill special potions</div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, July 1, 2014 at 5:59pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Isabelle Zhang are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, July 1, 2014 at 3:56pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Kayla Ruth Terry are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, July 1, 2014 at 10:42am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Eric Sun are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, July 1, 2014 at 9:31am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Lydia Lim are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, July 1, 2014 at 8:54am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Courtney Lee are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 30, 2014 at 10:55pm EDT</div><div>Tinny K Chen<br /></div><div class="comment">hi! :D</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 30, 2014 at 10:54pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Tinny K Chen are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, June 28, 2014 at 6:03pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Vindhya Rapolu are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, June 22, 2014 at 11:29pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Tanuja Anne are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, June 22, 2014 at 7:27pm EDT</div><div>Holly Lin<br /></div><div class="comment">I Literally love all your friends! but i love you the most!

You are such a sweet and awesome friend.

I am so lucky that we are best friends. I still remember when I first met you in 3rd grade and you were wearing your thin blue wiry glasses and you were hiding behind your mom with a book, hehe, you were so cutes :3 Once we became the best of friends, you became far from shy, but you are still cutes &lt;3 From then on, we&#039;ve had so many fun and amazing times together, from elementary school and building things in TAG (I still have the popsicle stick house with all the stuff inside LOL), to chinese school (oh, chinese school haha), to middle school together, and now, highschool. You are amazing, hilarious, smart, beautiful, and so much more. Every year spent with you is amazing because we spent it together. I hope that we will get to spend many more years together!

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 now brings the franchise to its powerful final chapter in which Katniss Everdeen [Jennifer Lawrence] realizes the stakes are no longer just for survival – they are for the future.

With the nation of Panem in a full scale war, Katniss confronts President Snow [Donald Sutherland] in the final showdown. Teamed with a group of her closest friends – including Gale [Liam Hemsworth], Finnick [Sam Claflin] and Peeta [Josh Hutcherson] – Katniss goes off on a mission with the unit from District 13 as they risk their lives to liberate the citizens of Panem, and stage an assassination attempt on President Snow who has become increasingly obsessed with destroying her.  The mortal traps, enemies, and moral choices that await Katniss will challenge her more than any arena she faced in The Hunger Games.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 is directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong and features an acclaimed cast including Academy Award®-winner Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Academy Award®-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone with Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland reprising their original roles from The Hunger Games and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The impressive lineup is joined by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 co-stars Academy Award®-winner Julianne Moore, Mahershala Ali, Natalie Dormer, Wes Chatham, Elden Henson and Evan Ross.

So I know I&#039;m kind of late on this, cuz it ended yesterday, but Whirlwind was AMAZING! God definitely worked in all of us when we were teaching, talking to, or even playing with the kids there (who by the way were SOOOOO CUTE). This was my first mission trip, so I wasn&#039;t really sure of what to expect, but WOW. I hope that we can continue forming relationships with the kids there, and get to know more of the adults in that community as well. I also hope that I may be able to live my life for God and trust that His will is perfect and good. Thank God for this great experience and a great mission team! Also, thank everyone for keeping us in your prayers and thoughts. ♥ +Mr.Zhang, Tony Zhang, and David Zhang.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, June 6, 2013 at 1:32pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Andrew Lai are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, June 6, 2013 at 8:58am EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Abraham Xiong are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, June 5, 2013 at 10:02pm EDT</div>Michelle Liu and Carol Zhou are now friends.<div></div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 3, 2013 at 2:37pm EDT</div><div class="comment">WOW.

Heartless Parodyy- By Daniel Li and Michelle Liu
In the night he stole my pho, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his bowl
To a person so heartless
How could you eat my ramen?
How could you eat my ramen?

How could you be so 
Cold as a banana when it’s freezed, yo
Just remember that you ate my pho, though
You need to watch the way you eatin’ my pho
I mean after all the foods we&#039;ve dug into
I mean after all the noodles that we’ve slurped through
Hey yo, I know some things you ate without me
Hey yo, you took all my ramen without asking

And now I wanna get it back, I asked for pho, please
But the lunch lady acts like she don’t know me
You got a customer, well I got money
But in the end I’m still so hungry.

In the night he stole my pho, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his bowl
To a person so heartless
How could you eat my ramen?
How could you eat my ramen?

How could be so Dr. Eat Pho?
You&#039;re bringin&#039; out a side of me that I don&#039;t know
I decided I was gonna let it go so
Why you stealing all my food, I don’t know.

Why are you being so mad at me for?
My noodles keep getting hot then cold, oh
I won&#039;t stop, cuz I miss my noodles
And I already know how this thing go

You run and tell your friends that you&#039;re eating my meat
They say that they don&#039;t eat randomly on the stree
You wait a couple months then you gon&#039; see
That big piece of meat’ll be eaten by me

In the night he stole my pho, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his bowl
To a person so heartless
How could you eat my ramen?
How could you eat my ramen?

Eatin’ eatin’ eatin’ bro
Can we both just let it go
They don&#039;t know what stew we chew
They don&#039;t know &#039;bout me and you

So I got somethin&#039; new to eat
But you can’t ever steal my meat
And we just gon&#039; be frenemies

i know you stole my meat
and it was really wrong
youll never make it right
ill steal your pie tonight

In the night he stole my pho, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his bowl
To a person so heartless
How could you eat my ramen?
How could you eat my ramen?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, April 24, 2013 at 10:28pm EDT</div><div class="comment">10 Likes. Stolen from Daniel Li and Seungmin Yoon

Once you saw a rose grow,
It was high now low.
Didn’t notice a birdie could fly
now it’s in the blue sky.
I saw a snake go,
Watched a duck get low.
You weren’t seeing
That I was being.
Know that God’s glory is here.
There is nothing to fear.
You and I have memories,
That don’t fade easily.

Fixing Student Behavioral Problems: One Page At A Time.
Problem: In previous years, students have had too much extra time that they start making bad choices. This experiment tests the effect of homework on student behavior in school and out of school.
Question: How much homework can a student receive everyday and still be able to function properly with less than 6 hours of sleep every night? 
Hypothesis: If we teachers give 3 hours of homework per night per class, students will get less than 6 hours off sleep per night and still be able to function properly...

we used to be each rly quiet and shy in class. i love how nice you are to people you dont even know and how kind you are to your friends. you think of everyone and how they would feel if, for example, we didn&#039;t save them a seat at sitan&#039;s concert. both of us arent as shy as we used to be, and i consider you as one of the people i know i can trust and talk to about anything. ily sis &lt;3

just know that even though i havent known you for that long or i guess rly talked to you much until recently, that ur rly funny and always make me laugh. you are awesome at the instrument that you play, and rly nice to everyone even when your annoyed at ppl&#039;s childish-ness... you probably dont even know who you are and that im talking about you ...and imma stop here... ttyl~ &lt;3</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, September 27, 2012 at 8:20pm EDT</div><div class="comment">Dear closest girl friend,
ive known you since we both attended Shakerag Elementary at age 6. you have no idea how nervous i was that day. having you there relieved a lot of the pressure. i feel like weve grown up alot, but we still havent changed (much). we still tease each other, and point out random things to each other. you deff know more about me and my life than anyone else. yeah, sometimes we do have our different views but i dont think ive ever fought with you before. we do most everything together, except for dance and math, and im proud to be your friend. anyways, you know i love you :)
